Backend APIs (16/16) passed successfully including new multi-prompt document and text analysis endpoints. Frontend authentication and basic dashboard functionality working. Multi-prompt selection UI elements present but session persistence issues prevent complete frontend testing. All core multi-prompt backend functionality confirmed working via direct API testing.",
